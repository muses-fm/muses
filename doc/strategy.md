## What’s the brand’s why, how, and what?

### Why

Fundamentally:
- Artists want to have their music added to playlists as a vehicle to increase their exposure.
- Curators want to have their attention and constructive feedback rewarded.
- Listeners want to find carefully curated playlists that capture unique music tastes.
- We want to help create a thriving community connecting them all.

More concretely:
- [PlaylistPush](https://playlistpush.com/), a similar platform, is making a business out of artists' hopes to get their songs featured in playlists. A private company is controlling the prices for artists and the reward scheme for curators. They prevent artists to contact curators to keep them paying. The platform's reputation system encourages curators to feature as many songs as possible, dissolving the unique taste of playlists and going against listeners' best interest.
- We believe it is possible to build a community-owned platform focused on music promotion and curation, while keeping everyone's incentives aligned, listeners included.

### How

Basically:
- Artists send tracks they want to promote to the platform, hoping that they will get added in public playlists. They need to pay for this.
- Curators listen to matching songs, give constructive feedback and potentially add them in their public playlists. They get paid for this.
- Listeners will receive tokens by participating in the platform (e.g. playlist tagging). They can donate tokens to artists.

Additionally:
- Reward mechanisms allow listeners to contact curators, and curators to contact artists, to build connections based on passion for music.
- Token economics and governance mechanisms will allow the community to determine the parameters and evolution of the platform.

### What

- A music promotion / curation / taste refinement platform.
- A hub for artists, curators and music gourmets to connect and build community.

## Who's the target audience

### Music producers / managers

- New artists who struggle to promote their music and launch their career.
- Established artists who want to promote new releases or increase their exposure.
- Public relations managers and agencies helping artists.

### Music curators

- Playlist curators looking for new music to extend their public playlists.
- DJs looking to extend their music library with fresh music.

### Music gourmets

- Music listeners who are passionate about finding and helping others find unique music tastes.
- Music fans who want to support and get to know the artists that create the music tastes they love.

## What makes the brand and platform different?

Brand:
- It's building the first music promotion and curation platform that is community-owned.
- It's building the first music promotion platform that takes into account listeners' taste.
- It's building the first music taste refinement platform.
- It's focused on open source development and community stewardship, avoiding to become a financial intermediary.

Platform:
- It's built on decentralized infrastructure ([DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/)).
- The money that the artists will pay to promote their music will go to curators directly, the financial intermediary being a blockchain.

## What are the 5 key goals over the next five years?

Music:
- The platform has become the de-facto promotion tool for independent artists and PR agencies.
- The platform is the best way for music lovers that wish to discover new music tastes.
- The platform has fostered the creation/discovery of dozens of new, unique musical genres.

Community:
- The platform has enabled thousands of meaningful connections between artists, curators and passionate music lovers.
- The platform has helped hundreds of online communities emerge, each with its own unique taste of music.
  - These online communities organize themselves in physical spaces (e.g. clubs, festivals) to enjoy the music they love, together.
  - Driven by a passion to perform and share music, community members start organizing live events together.

## What are the biggest fears in achieving these goals?

Financial:
- Initial funding may be hard to attain, hindering the speed at which the platform can be developed.
- Once launched, the token economic mechanisms cannot sustain the maintenance/development cost of the platform.
- Once launched, the token economic mechanisms make the platform too expensive or not interesting for community members.

Technical:
- DFINITY may fail to become a well-established alternative to build decentralized applications.
- If that is the case, it may be too hard to migrate out from the DFINITY ecosystem.

UX:
- Artists and curators don't engage with the network after they find each other.
- The matching algorithm doesn't do good matching between tracks and playlists.
